# Project5
Now this project was a doozy lemme tell ya. As I type this at 5 in the morning, I can only look back on the choices I made that got me here with a tinge of disgust.
The problem solving process for this project went a lil something like this:
As with all projects in this class, it was first tackled with ludicrous confusion, as I did not know what anything was
Then, after consulting with numerous other people in various stages of earning a Computer Science or adjacent major, the process truly began
The first matter of business was the GUI, mainly figuring out how GridBagLayout works, after that, smooth sailing
This achievement was mostly gained with the help of a friend who had already taken the class, and his reluctant agreement to touch GridBag again
At various points throughout the project I calculated how my grade would be effected by not finishing the project
Once the GUI itself was finished, the real coding began, it was already 2 am at this point
Once the real coding started, it was halted by a roadblock, I had no idea how to use an ActionListener, nor did I figure it out until I managed to find a good enough example with the help of the internet
Once the learning curve had been hopped, I moved on to the simple matter of copy pasting my older projects into this new one, with the Hamming Distance related methods
An open dialogue was kept with other students in regards to the nature of this project, and their advice was taken into account while providing my own in turn
Most problems encountered during the process were solved by either frantic googling or via dialogue with fellow classmates, along with some playful banter to keep spirits up at 4 am
Now, as it edges on to 5:30, I finish making my UML, and I finish writing this README. I hope you have mercy on me, I've had a bad time.
Also, you didn't really say how to submit the UML, so ask me here to show it to you, it's on my computer
